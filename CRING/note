CRING ransomware encrypts business user and server data with AES-128 + RSA-8192 and then demands a ~ 2 BTC ransom to get the files back. The attackers exploit Internet-exposed Fortigate SSL VPN servers unpatched against the CVE-2018-13379 vulnerability, which allows them to breach their target's network. After the malicious actors have established initial access, they drop a customized Mimikatz sample followed by CobaltStrike threat emulation framework deployed using a malicious PowerShell script. The ransomware encrypts only specific files on the compromised devices after removing backup files and killing Microsoft Office and Oracle Database processes.
